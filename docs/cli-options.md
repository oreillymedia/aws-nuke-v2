# Options

This is not a comprehensive list of options, but rather a list of features that I think are worth highlighting.

## Skip Alias Checks

`--no-alias-check` will skip the check for the AWS account alias. This is useful if you are running in an account that does not have an alias.

## Skip Prompts

`--no-prompt` will skip the prompt to verify you want to run the command. This is useful if you are running in a CI/CD environment.
